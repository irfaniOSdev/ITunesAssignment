# ITunesAssignment
Itunes API Assignment developed for a company interview process. 


Assignment has the following modules.

    Network Manager
    Search Page
    Media Type Selection
    Search Results Page
    Search Results Detail Page

I have implemented the following items according to the assignment requirements.

    Codable for data parsing
    Swiftlint for style & conventions
    Closures for data binding
    Cocoapods dependency manager

Following are the steps to the test assignment.

    Unzip project
    Open xcworkspace
    Run Xcode Project
    Type search term in textfield
    Tap forward arrow button to go to media entity selection screen
    Select entities and press done and move to previous screen
    Press submit button and move to search results screen
    Search results screen has two layouts. You can switch them.
    Tap any cell to enter its detail screen
    Tap the thumbnail of the image to play the video if it has a video URL.



As the assignment has mentioned, I can use any design pattern so I have developed this App in MVVM. I have followed POP and Solid Principles and tried to make sure that separation of concerns are achieved.
